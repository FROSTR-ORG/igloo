Frostr keyset manager and remote signer.

### Implemented Features
- [x] Key generation
- [x] Key rotation
- [x] Nsec import
- [x] Remote signing

### TODO
- [ ] Encrypted App State
    <!-- 
    Generate a random salt number
    User puts in custom password for a given share
    use @noble/hashes to derive key from password and salt (pbkdf2)
    use key to encrypt key share in json file (leave other fields unencrypted)
    In file save Buff.join([salt, encryptedData])
    In file read, split the data into salt and encryptedData and use the salt with user entered password to derive the key 
    -->
- [ ] Manage shares (rotate)
  <!-- 
  - If nsec is entered for rotation then get the pubkey of that nsec and verify that it matches the pubkey of the current share loaded in the UI.
  -->
  <!-- 
  Ensure that keyset with name already saved in file system can not be created again.
  -->
  <!-- Generate nsec button inside of form, unify forms. -->
  <!-- options for manage shares: 
  - recover nsec from threshold of shares 
  - create new keyset with nsec.
  -->
- [ ] FORM VALIDATION FOR SHARE, GROUP, RELAY, NSEC, HEX PRIVKEY.
